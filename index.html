                <p>The Propellant is a blog meant to inspire the use of human-centered and design thinking strategies to achieve product goals, educate on exercises to create user experiences, and encourage collaboration between all disciplines within a product team. </p>
              <p>Rockets work because of propulsion. In order for the rocket to rush forward, something has to rush backwards. That thing is the propellant. The content in this newsletter strives to be a propellant for product development teams - so we can all rise together in knowledge and personal growth. </p>

             <h4> Are you a baby? üë∂ </h4>
          <p> A <ahref="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/tyro">tyro</a> is a beginner in anything, which means you'll probably make a fool of yourself. Yeah, nobody wants to be a tyro. A baby is the ultimate tyro because it doesn't know anything when it's first born. It's a tyro AT LIFE ITSELF. So, in a way, being a tyro also means that you're a baby. Ha.
        <p> However, being a tyro is an important skill to have! Some may say it's at the heart of being a designer - asking 'why?' With every new project, you should be asking why - multiple times. Whether you're the one with the idea, or the one listening to the idea, you shouldn't commit to a decision until someone asks why.</p>
          <p>However, that can be easier said than done. Especially when we face the pressure of feeling important or pleasing a stakeholder.

          <h4> Why, Why, Why</h4>
          <p> Now that we've established the benefit to being a tyro, or a baby, let's explore how you can transform yourself into one. Adopting this novice mindset is a proven strategy in uncovering problems. At this point you might be saying, "but I already know the problem." True. You probably do know a problem or some problems. But, do you know the <i>right</i> problem or the <strong>root</strong> problem?</p>
          <p>Let's use a well-known design thinking method called the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/5-whys">5 Whys.</a> Luckily for us babies, it's super simple. Just ask why 5 times to build a cause-effect chain until you find the root cause.</p>
          <p>Here's the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/5-whys">example</a> made famous by Toyata:<p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Why did the robot stop?</strong>   >  The circuit overloaded, making a fuse blow.</li>
            <li>Why did the fuse blow?   >  There was insufficient lubrication on the bearings, so they locked up.</li>
            <li>Why did the bearings lock?  > The oil pump on the robot wasn‚Äôt circulating enough oil.</li>
            <li>Why was there poor circulation?   >  The pump intake was clogged with metal shavings.</li>
            <li>Why was the pump clogged?  > <strong>There was no filter on the pump</strong>.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>As you can see, the Toyota team could have ended up spending time and money solving for 4 different problems before realizing they could have just put filters on the pumps. üòÖ </p>

<p>In fact, you shouldn't even start a project or hold a kickoff until you pitch the idea to a few people you trust for feedback. Ideally, it would be good to ask people from different teams that will be involved. Remember, this isn't meant to slow you down or be redundant. It's meant to bring focus, so you can spend 1 hour now to save 10000 hours later. ‚è≥</p>
      <p>It also can help you challenge your own big opinions and assumptions about problems we need to solve for. So let's pump the breaks so we can filter out the symptoms to find our root problem! üí°

          <h5> Challenge #1 </h5>
          <p> Take 15 minutes today to take a look at a project you're working on and write down the problem you're trying to solve. After, try to write the reason why. Then, repeat 4 times.<p>
          <p>Let's take a temperature check. How well do you know the root problem behind the project?</p>
          <ul>
            <li><input type="radio">I'm a total baby and don't know anything about the root problem.</li>
            <li><input type="radio">I know more than the baby, I can tell you that much.</li>
            <li><input type="radio">I have the biggest brain. I know the root problem like the back of my hand.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>If you're cool, set up some time and do this exercise as a workshop with your team and see where they stand. Better yet, do this exercise with a cross-functional team before committing to a project! Hint hint, wink wink üòâ </p>

          <h4>Don't Worry, Nobody Knows Anything</h4>
          <p>
Please don't hesitate if you have feedback on how to improve this. More importantly, please let me know if you'd like to contribute to The Propellant! I want this to be community driven way to share and celebrate product development. </p>
          <p>So, in conclusion, I admit it. I am a total baby and don't know anything. Especially when it comes to blogs. So maybe that means I'm on to something cool.ü§î</p>
